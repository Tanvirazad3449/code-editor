# Code Editor Project

## Overview

This project is a code editor designed to showcase front-end development skills using Next.js. It serves as a demonstration of modern front-end technologies and best practices, providing a robust and interactive user interface for writing and editing code. The project utilizes a variety of libraries and frameworks to deliver a seamless and efficient coding experience.

## Technologies Used
